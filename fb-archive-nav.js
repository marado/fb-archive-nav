	identity();
	// * You want to be able to navigate by year;
	yearNav();
	// * You want to hide all those empty entries that are showed up in there;
	hideEmpty();
	// * You want the page data to be shown in chronologic order...

	// FIXME: this is quite innefecient: each of these functions will cycle
	// through everything (at least once) and we'll be doing it over and over
	// again... Once this is implemented, let's optimize it!
